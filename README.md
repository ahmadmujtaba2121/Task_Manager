# 📝 Task Manager with Pomodoro Timer

A simple, clean task manager with Pomodoro focus timer built using **React**, **Context API**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This app allows you to:
- Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as done ✅
- Focus using a built-in Pomodoro timer ⏱
- Store tasks in `localStorage` so they persist on refresh
- Get visual feedback with clean **toast notifications**

> ⚡ This was a small project to practice real-world React structure with reusable components and shared state using Context API.

🙋‍♂️ Notes
This was a learning project — built piece-by-piece while learning Context API, state sharing, and Tailwind component structure.
It's not perfect, but it's clean, functional, and easy to improve later.
